## Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development
For this section, I am following the lessons in a book with this exact title, by ***Jeremy Gibson Bond*** <br>
<br>

Note on notations within codes in book:
- old lines in normal weight
- **new lines in bold weight**
- ... - ellipses indicate skipped lines
- {...} - ellipses in braces indicate skipped code from a pre-existing function/method

DEBLOCKING (e.g. in Bartok):
- break up blocks of (similar) cards.
- if not done, the next game will end much quicker as players are very likely dealt cards that match each other

How to DEBLOCK?
- shuffle 7x
- doesn't work? use one of these:
  - deal the cards into 7 piles, then shuffle them together
  - deal the cards out face-down into a large spread out pool, mix them like mixing water (domino style)
  - play 52 pickup: throw all the cards on the floor and pick them up

After PLAYTESTs, ask:
- Is the difficulty level appropriate for the intended audience? too difficult / too easy / just right?
- Is the outcome of the game based on strategy or chance? randomness play a strong role / game too deterministic? -such that after one player has taken the lead, others cannot catch up
- Does the game have meaningful, interesting decisions? On your turn, do you have several choices, & are they interesting?
- Is the game interesting when it's not your turn? Do you have any effect on the other players' turn? Do their turn turns have any immediate effect on you?

E.g. in BARTOK, the paper version:
- ask players to write down their answers to these questions individually, then discuss as a group. This keeps the responses diverse, uninfluenced.

Game design is merely a process:
- Incrementally MODIFY THE RULES
  - changing very few things between each playtest
- Playtest the game with the new rules
- Analyze how the feel of the game is altered by the new rules
- Design new rules that may move the feel of the game in the desired direction
- Repeat until satisfied

I.e., ITERATIVE DESIGN

WATCH OUT FOR PLAYTESTING FLUKES
- The occurence of an unlikely event / external factor e.g. a weird shuffle may cause a single play to feel really different from the others. Be sure to play through the game multiple times so as to avoid making rule changes based on a fluke.

GAME FEEL
- do you want it to be
  - exciting?
  - cutthroat?
  - leisurely and slow?
  - based more on strategy, or chance?
- once there is a general idea of the desired feel, come up with additional rules that can push the feel of the game in that direction

Tips regarding designing new rules:
- Change only one thing in between each playtest
  - so then it is easier to pinpoint which changes influence a certain effect towards a feel
- The bigger the change, the more frequent the tests need to be to ensure the subsequent change decision is not based on flukes
  - better to keep the changes subtle such that one or two plays can say alot of how each change affects the feel
- Change a number (no matter how small) and you change the experience

Additionally:
- adding new rules can be easier when the playtests are done with friends
  - in person rather than with digital prototypes
    - This highlights the importance of paper prototypes, even when designing digital ones

## Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development
For this section, I am following the lessons in a book with this exact title, by ***Jeremy Gibson Bond*** <br>
<br>

Note on notations within codes in book:
- old lines in normal weight
- **new lines in bold weight**
- ... - ellipses indicate skipped lines
- {...} - ellipses in braces indicate skipped code from a pre-existing function/method

DEBLOCKING (e.g. in Bartok):
- break up blocks of (similar) cards.
- if not done, the next game will end much quicker as players are very likely dealt cards that match each other

How to DEBLOCK?
- shuffle 7x
- doesn't work? use one of these:
  - deal the cards into 7 piles, then shuffle them together
  - deal the cards out face-down into a large spread out pool, mix them like mixing water (domino style)
  - play 52 pickup: throw all the cards on the floor and pick them up

After PLAYTESTs, ask:
- Is the difficulty level appropriate for the intended audience? too difficult / too easy / just right?
- Is the outcome of the game based on strategy or chance? randomness play a strong role / game too deterministic? -such that after one player has taken the lead, others cannot catch up
- Does the game have meaningful, interesting decisions? On your turn, do you have several choices, & are they interesting?
- Is the game interesting when it's not your turn? Do you have any effect on the other players' turn? Do their turn turns have any immediate effect on you?

E.g. in BARTOK, the paper version:
- ask players to write down their answers to these questions individually, then discuss as a group. This keeps the responses diverse, uninfluenced.
